## Problems
 1. Parse the [SMAC data files](https://figshare.com/articles/Social_Mobilization_Action_Consortium_Community_Engagement_data_from_the_2014-2016_Sierra_Leone_Ebola_outbreak/8247002).
 2. Reproduce the analyses from the [SMAC paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/661959v1).
    - Number of Community Visits time series
    - Burial by Chiefdom and burial type time series
    - Community By-laws time series
 3. Identify surprising chiefdoms: Regions that had a lot more or a lot less cases than neighbors.
 Do they stand-out in social mobilization data?
 4. Continue the exploration in interesting directions:
    - Compare the attack rate in people to the attack rate over chiefdoms.
    - Is there any evidence that misinformation or distrust in the intervention lead to
lower rates of reporting, safe burials and referrals?
    - Are social mobilizers from different organizations getting similar ratings in the
different evaluation metrics?
